# Run in Terminal
An Alfred Workflow to **execute selected file**, **cd to selected folder**, and **run selected text** in Terminal with one hotkey.

## Installation
1. Download [Run in Termianl.alfredworkflow](https://github.com/willbchang/alfred-run-in-terminal/releases/latest).
2. Double click `Run in Terminal.alfredworkflow` to install.
3. Click `Import` Button.
4. Double click `Hotkey` and set your shortcut.(I'm using <kbd>alt</kbd> + <kbd>t</kbd>).

## Usage
<kbd>alt</kbd> + <kbd>t</kbd>
- Launch Terminal if Terminal isn't active.
- Bring Terminal to the front window if Terminal is active.
- Run selected text in Terminal, it avoids `$ ` in the beginning of the first line.
- Open selected file/folder from Finder or Alfred File Browser.
  1. **Enable Quick Search Mode** in `Features -> File Action`.
  2. Launch Alfred and press <kbd>spacebar</kbd> or input a single quote.
  3. Move the highlight block to the destination folder.
  4. *Notice*: if you enabled `Advanced -> History` and browse file with it, you should use <kbd>tab</kbd> or <kbd>‚Üê</kbd> or <kbd>‚Üí</kbd> to avoid Alfred's default selection.
  5. Press <kbd>alt</kbd> + <kbd>t</kbd> or your own shortcut.
  

### Change Terminal App
1. Open **Alfred Preferences** -> **Workflows**  -> **Open in Terminal**.
2. Double click `Run Script`, replace `Terminal` with `YOUR TERMINAL APP`.
3. Make sure the app name surrounds with **double quote** `""`.
